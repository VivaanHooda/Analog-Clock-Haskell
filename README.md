## Description

This Haskell project creates an analog clock that visually represents the current time. It uses the Gloss library to render graphics and the Data.Time and Data.Time.LocalTime libraries to manage time-related calculations.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) and [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html) installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/specdrake28/Analog-Clock-Haskell.git
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Analog-Clock-Haskell
   
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cabal build
   ```
5. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cabal run
  

## Usage

1. Upon running the project, a graphical window will appear, displaying an analog clock that represents the current time.
2. The clock features:
   - Hour hand
   - Minute hand
   - Second hand
   - Hour markers (1 to 12)
   - Minute markers
